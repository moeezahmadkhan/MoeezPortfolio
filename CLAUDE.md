# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A single-page personal portfolio for **Moeez Ahmad Khan** (AI/ML Engineer). It is themed as a Harry Potter / wizarding "archive": a candlelit 3D hero with a floating wizard figurine, followed by scroll-driven chapters (About, Spells, Grimoire of projects, Chronicles, Owl-post contact). Pure front end — no backend, no API.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Vite dev server (host:true → exposed on LAN, default port 5173)
npm run build    # tsc -b (typecheck) then vite build → dist/
npm run preview  # serve the production build
```

There is no test runner, linter, or formatter configured. `npm run build` is the only correctness gate — it runs `tsc -b` first, so a type error fails the build. Type-check without bundling via `npx tsc -b`.

## Architecture

Two visual layers stacked by `App.tsx`:

1. **A fixed full-viewport WebGL canvas** (`src/scene/`) rendered once, behind everything.
2. **Scrollable HTML content** (`src/components/`) on top.

The 3D scene never re-mounts as you scroll. Instead the **camera moves through the static scene** while HTML chapters scroll past — this is the core trick of the site.

### The scroll bridge (`src/scroll.ts`)

`scrollState` is a **module-level mutable singleton**, deliberately *outside* React state. A scroll/pointer listener (installed by `useScrollTracker`) writes `progress` (0→1 down the page), `raw` px, and `pointerX/Y` (−1→1) into it. The R3F components read it inside their `useFrame` loops every frame. This keeps scrolling from ever triggering a React re-render of the Canvas tree. **Do not lift `scrollState` into `useState`/context** — that would re-render the whole scene on every scroll event.

### The scene (`src/scene/`)

- `Scene.tsx` — the `<Canvas>`: lighting rig (candlelight + spot/rim/key lights), `Environment` with inline `Lightformer`s (no network HDRI), `Sparkles`, `ContactShadows`, and the `EffectComposer` post chain (**Bloom** is what makes the gold glow, plus Vignette + SMAA). Performance is adaptive: `PerformanceMonitor` + `AdaptiveDpr` drop the `dpr` on slow devices.
- `CameraRig.tsx` — drives the camera. `KEYS` is a keyframe array (`at` = scroll fraction → camera `pos`/`look`). It samples + smoothsteps between keyframes by `scrollState.progress`, adds eased pointer parallax, and lerps frame-rate-independently. **To re-time the camera per chapter, edit `KEYS`.**
- `WizardModel.tsx` — loads `/models/wizard.glb` (a static, rig-less ~16MB mesh; animated purely in-scene via Float + rotation). The `reveal` prop (0→1) scales it up out of the rune circle during the intro. Materials are cloned + tweaked (emissive warmth) so HMR never mutates shared state.
- `RuneCircle.tsx` — procedural sigil on the floor; fades out by ~22% scroll (`scrollState.progress`).
- `Candlelight.tsx` — a `pointLight` flickering via layered sines.

### The intro timeline (`App.tsx`)

drei's `useProgress` gates a preloader. When assets finish loading, a `requestAnimationFrame` ramp drives `reveal` 0→1 over 1.8s, passed into `Scene → WizardModel` to "conjure" the figurine. The preloader fades out via framer-motion `AnimatePresence`.

### HTML chapters (`src/components/`)

- `data.ts` — **all portfolio content** (projects, spellbook/skills, chronicles/experience) lives here as typed arrays. Edit copy here, not in JSX.
- `Sections.tsx` — `About`, `Spells`, `Grimoire`, `Chronicles`, `OwlPost` — maps over `data.ts` into the wizard-themed sections.
- `Reveal.tsx` — `Reveal` (scroll-into-view blur+rise) and `IgniteHeading` (per-word stagger). Shared scroll-reveal primitives built on framer-motion `whileInView`.
- `Hero.tsx`, `Tilt.tsx` (pointer tilt cards), `ScrollRail.tsx` (chapter progress wand on the page edge), `Cursor.tsx` (custom wand-tip cursor + sparks, disabled on coarse pointers).

> Note: `App.tsx` currently renders `<Hero>` plus a placeholder "Grimoire — coming next" section. The full chapter components (`Sections.tsx`, `ScrollRail.tsx`, `Cursor.tsx`, `data.ts`, etc.) exist but are **not yet wired into `App.tsx`** — wiring them in (and matching section `id`s to `CameraRig` `KEYS` and `ScrollRail` chapters) is the in-progress work.

### Section ↔ camera ↔ rail coupling

Three places share the chapter ordering and must stay in sync: the section `id`s in `Sections.tsx`, the `KEYS` scroll fractions in `CameraRig.tsx`, and the `chapters` anchors in `ScrollRail.tsx`. Changing the number/order of chapters means updating all three.

## Conventions

- **Design tokens** live in `src/styles/global.css` as CSS custom properties (palette: ink `#07070d`, gold `#e7c27d`, rune-teal; fonts Cinzel / Cormorant Garamond / JetBrains Mono loaded in `index.html`). Use the variables; don't hard-code hex in components except inside the 3D scene where three.js needs literal colors.
- Each component pairs with a sibling `.css` file imported at the top.
- Wizarding metaphor is intentional throughout copy and class names (spells = skills, grimoire = projects, owl post = contact, "incantations" = playful project names). Keep new content in voice.

## Verifying 3D renders headlessly

`puppeteer-core` is a dev dependency for screenshotting the WebGL output. Drive it with system Chrome (`/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable`) using `--use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader`. The `glBlitFramebuffer` WebGL warning under SwiftShader is harmless.

## Large assets

`wizard.glb` and the CV PDF live under `public/` and are served as-is. Two extra source GLBs and a PDF sit in the repo root (not served). The shipped model is `public/models/wizard.glb`.
